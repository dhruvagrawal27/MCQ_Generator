       "{'text': \"Maharana Pratap (1540-1597) was a renowned Rajput ruler of Mewar (in present-day Rajasthan, India), celebrated for his fierce resistance against the Mughal Empire. He was the eldest son of Udai Singh II and succeeded to the throne of Mewar in 1572.\\nMost famously, Pratap refused to submit to Mughal Emperor Akbar, unlike many other Rajput rulers of his time. The Battle of Haldighati (1576) against Akbar's forces, led by Man Singh I, is particularly legendary. Though Pratap's forces were outnumbered, he fought valiantly. His loyal horse Chetak died protecting him in this battle.\\nDespite losing Chittor, his capital, Pratap continued guerrilla warfare from the hills of Aravalli. He lived in difficult conditions in the forests but never gave up his struggle for independence. He managed to reclaim much of Mewar except Chittor through strategic warfare and maintained his sovereignty.\\nMaharana Pratap is remembered as a symbol of Rajput valor, patriotism, and resistance against foreign rule. His unwavering commitment to freedom and dignity, even in the face of hardship, has made him an iconic figure in Indian history. He remains an inspiration for his leadership, courage, and determination to protect his homeland's independence.\",\n",
